# Ad skipping browser extension

### ⚡️ Features

🎬 Skips embedded ads in **Prime Video**<br>
🎧 Obliterates ads in **Pandora**<br>
📺 Skips video-ads in **YouTube**

### Compatibilities

This is an _unofficial_ extension. This means it will work best in browsers that permit temporary/in-development extensions. If you try to use this in Safari, you will have to add it all over again **every single time you restart Safari** (or every time 24 hours passes).

I have included installation instructions for Google Chrome and for Brave Browser. This has also been fully tested in Microsoft Edge, and the installation instructions are nearly identical as for Google Chrome.

> ⚠️ This extension is a work in progress, which means you may encounter bugs. These bugs (and their workarounds) are detailed below.

### 🐞 Bugs (+ workarounds)

| application | problem | quick-fix |
|-|-|-|
| Prime Video | Ads are not being skipped | Refresh the page |
| Prime Video | I skipped ahead straight into an ad and it's taking FOREVER to skip | Refresh the page, and **try to always leave a buffer of a few seconds before an ad-break** when skipping ahead |
| Pandora | I tried switching the station, and now I'm getting ALL THE ADS | Copy the link to that station and then navigate _directly there_ instead of going through Pandora's station-selection menu |
| Any/All | This extension is clearly hacked together and all around just not great and you bring shame on yourself and your family for putting this out in public | No argument here 🤷
